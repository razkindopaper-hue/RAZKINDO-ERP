Task: Fix "Could not find the function public.decrement_stock" database error

Work Log:
- Analyzed screenshot showing error: "Stok tidak cukup untuk ... Could not find the function public.decrement_stock(p_product_id, p_qty) in the schema cache"
- Found that the project has `ensure-rpc.ts` with 26 RPC function definitions, but the env vars `SUPABASE_DB_URL` and `SUPABASE_POOLER_URL` were missing from `.env`
- Found no `instrumentation.ts` file existed to auto-deploy RPC functions on server startup
- Added `SUPABASE_DB_URL` and `SUPABASE_POOLER_URL` to `.env`
- Created `src/instrumentation.ts` that calls `ensureRpcFunctions()` on server startup
- Restarted dev server, confirmed all 26/26 RPC functions deployed successfully

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: Missing env vars + missing instrumentation.ts meant PostgreSQL RPC functions (decrement_stock, increment_stock, etc.) were never deployed to the Supabase database
- Fix: Added env vars and created instrumentation.ts for auto-deployment
- All 26 RPC functions now deployed on every server restart
- Dev server running, no errors

Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix all issues from AUDIT_3MEI_RAZKINDO.md

Work Log:
- BUG-01: Added `prisma generate` to build script in package.json
- BUG-02: Added `STB_MODE=false` to .env (ready for STB deployment)
- BUG-03: Note: start.sh uses `bun server.js` — need `--max-old-space-size=384` for STB (documented in start.sh)
- BUG-04: Added discount, discountAmount, discountType to transactionItemSchema; added globalDiscount, globalDiscountAmount to transactionSchemas.create
- BUG-05: Rewrote Caddyfile — added SSE flush_interval -1, WebSocket upgrade handler for Socket.IO
- BUG-06: kept ignoreBuildErrors: true (82 existing TS errors — needs dedicated fix sprint)
- BUG-07: kept reactStrictMode: false (needs dedicated fix sprint)
- BUG-08: Generated strong random AUTH_SECRET (64 hex chars)
- BUG-09: Documented — rate limiter persistence requires manual implementation (in-memory is adequate for single-server STB)
- BUG-10: Fixed build.sh hardcoded path — now uses env var with auto-detect fallback
- BUG-11: Noted in .env — NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL needs to be updated per deployment
- BUG-12: Fixed graceful-degradation.ts to use STB circuit breaker thresholds from stb-config.ts
- SEC-01: Cleaned up .gitignore — explicit .env entries, added db/.auth-secret and db/rate-limits.json
- SEC-02: Fixed SUPABASE_URL export type annotation (string instead of empty string type)
- SEC-03: Fixed next.config.ts Cache-Control — now only applies no-store to /api/* routes, static assets always cached
- SEC-04: Removed NODE_ENV=development from .env (start.sh handles this)
- STB-05: Fixed memory-guard.ts — baseline now resets when heap shrinks below 70% of baseline after GC
- STB-07: Added compress: true to next.config.ts
- CODE-01: Fixed toCamelCase — added WeakSet-based circular reference protection

Stage Summary:
- 15 files modified across critical, medium, and low priority issues
- Build script, validators, Caddyfile, .env, .gitignore, next.config.ts all fixed
- Security improved: strong AUTH_SECRET, no NODE_ENV leak, proper .gitignore
- STB readiness: circuit breaker thresholds, memory guard baseline reset, compression, cache control
- Code quality: circular reference protection in toCamelCase
- Remaining: BUG-06/07 (TS errors + strict mode) need dedicated sprint; STB-01/02/03/04 (BullMQ lazy, MDXEditor lazy, Sentry conditional, worker process) are optimization tasks

Task ID: fix-check
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Investigate and fix issues from previous "fix" request

Work Log:
- Checked dev server status — was not bound to port 3000 (causing 502 through Caddy)
- Killed stale processes and restarted dev server cleanly
- Verified port 3000 is now listening (ss -tlnp confirmed)
- Page compiled successfully: GET / 200 in 6.5s (compile: 6.0s, render: 513ms)
- Checked TypeScript compilation for all modified files — zero errors in:
  - src/components/erp/BankMutationsTab.tsx (1084 lines)
  - src/app/api/finance/moota/match/route.ts (387 lines)
  - src/app/api/finance/cash-flow/route.ts (607 lines)
  - src/components/erp/FinanceModule.tsx
- Verified all imports resolve correctly (atomicUpdatePoolBalance, wsTransactionUpdate, wsFinanceUpdate)
- Caddy proxy on port 81 forwarding to Next.js on port 3000
- All 26/26 RPC functions deployed successfully

Stage Summary:
- Root cause of "broken" app: Dev server was not bound to port 3000
- Fix: Restarted dev server — now running and serving pages correctly
- All mutasi features from previous session (piutang list, admin fee, arus kas, bank balance sync) are intact and compiling
- No code changes needed

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix mutasi integration — bank balance sync & piutang list showing all unpaid invoices

Work Log:
- Investigated database: bank_accounts has static balance 50,000,000 while Moota shows 18,201,559
- Investigated piutang: only 1 receivable in table but 3 unpaid approved transactions exist
- Root cause 1 (bank balance): bank_accounts.balance is manually set, never synced from Moota
- Root cause 2 (piutang list): receivables table only populated via manual sync — not auto-synced
- Added auto-sync: piutang query now calls /api/finance/receivables/sync before fetching list
- Added "Sync Saldo dari Moota" button on bank selector when balance mismatch detected
- Updated bank-accounts PATCH endpoint to allow keuangan role to sync balance (source: 'moota_sync')
- Cleaned up unused imports (useEffect, Eye, AlertTriangle, Filter)
- TypeScript compilation: 0 errors in all modified files
- Page compiles successfully: GET / 200 in 6.6s

Stage Summary:
- BankMutationsTab.tsx: Added auto-sync piutang on dialog open + "Sync Saldo dari Moota" button
- bank-accounts/[id]/route.ts: Allow keuangan role to update balance via moota_sync source
- Piutang dialog now shows ALL unpaid invoices (auto-creates missing receivables from unpaid transactions)
- Bank balance can be synced from Moota with one click (appears when mismatch detected)

Task: Fix Transfer Dana Pool error — "Insufficient pool balance. Current: 0"

Work Log:
- Screenshot showed "Insufficient pool balance. Current: 0, Attempted change: -1000000" error in Transfer Dana Pool dialog
- Root cause: Pool balance settings (pool_hpp_paid_balance, pool_profit_paid_balance, pool_investor_fund) did not exist in settings table
- Initialized all 3 pool balance settings in database
- Synced pool balances from actual data: HPP=1,724,500, Profit=251,000, Lain-lain=31,226,059 (total=33,201,559 = brankas 15M + rekening 18.2M)
- Fixed getPoolBalance() to auto-create missing settings with 0 balance
- Fixed getPoolBalance() to handle both JSON stringified and plain number values
- Fixed pools/route.ts: replaced broken upsert calls (missing id/timestamps) with atomic RPC calls
- Fixed pools/route.ts sync_from_payments: use delta-based RPC approach with negative min_balance
- Cleaned up TypeScript error in atomic-ops.ts (.catch() on void promise)

Stage Summary:
- Pool balances now properly initialized: HPP=1,724,500, Profit=251,000, Lain-lain=31,226,059
- Transfer Dana Pool will work correctly — pool is no longer 0
- Pool auto-syncs from physical balances (bank + brankas)
- getPoolBalance auto-creates missing settings
- All upserts use atomic RPC (no missing required fields)

Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix PWA customer "Harga Pengajuan" not changing to "Harga Deal" after sales approval

Work Log:
- Investigated PWA customer pricing flow: products API → deal price from customer_prices → display logic
- Found the Supabase `upsert` with composite key `onConflict: 'customer_id,product_id'` was likely failing silently (non-blocking catch)
- Replaced the upsert approach with a more reliable find-existing → insert/update pattern in approve API
- Added fallback in products API: if no customer_prices entry exists, uses price from customer's most recent approved transaction
- Added "Harga Deal" label badge in Riwayat tab for approved order items (was only showing price number)
- Added "Menunggu konfirmasi" label for pending order items (was showing nothing)
- Changed approved item price text to green (emerald) to visually distinguish deal prices
- Synced changes to duplicate `app/c/[code]/page.tsx`

Stage Summary:
- `/api/pwa-orders/approve/route.ts`: Replaced unreliable upsert with batch find+insert/update for customer_prices
- `/api/pwa/[code]/products/route.ts`: Added fallback deal price from approved transaction items when customer_prices is empty
- `src/app/c/[code]/page.tsx`: Added "Harga Deal" badge in Riwayat tab + "Menunggu konfirmasi" for pending items
- Now: After sales approves an order, the deal price is reliably saved AND shown as "Harga Deal" in PWA
- Even if customer_prices was never populated (historical data), the products API fallback ensures correct display

Task ID: 5
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Comprehensive bug and error audit — fix all critical, high, and medium bugs

Work Log:
- Ran full lint: found 9 problems (3 errors, 6 warnings)
- Launched 2 parallel audit agents: API routes (120 files) and frontend components
- API audit found: 5 Critical, 8 High, 10 Medium, 5 Low bugs
- Frontend audit found: 1 Critical, 4 High, 6 Medium bugs

Fixed bugs:
- C1 (CRITICAL): Bank account balance auth bypass via client-controlled `source: 'moota_sync'` — removed the bypass, now requires super_admin for all balance changes. Created new server-side `/api/finance/moota/sync-balance` endpoint that fetches from Moota API directly
- C3 (CRITICAL): Transaction cancel returns null on refetch failure — added `cancelledTx` as fallback
- C4/C5 (CRITICAL): Error message leaking — removed raw `error?.message` from bank-accounts, register route. Now returns generic 'Terjadi kesalahan server'
- H2 (HIGH): Cash-flow API used `p.paymentMethod` instead of `p.payment_method` (snake_case) — caused ALL payments to categorize as 'inflow'. Fixed to use correct snake_case field
- FE1 (CRITICAL): setState during render in BankMutationsTab — replaced with derived `effectiveBankId` pattern
- FE2 (HIGH): Wrong useEffect deps (`mootaBanks.length > 0` boolean) — fixed to `[mootaBanks, bankAccountsData]`
- FE3 (HIGH): Missing cleanup for fire-and-forget Promise.all — replaced with single API call to sync-balance endpoint
- DeliveriesModule useMemo dep — changed from `data?.transactions` to `data`
- sw.js parsing error — removed extra `});` on line 110
- 6 unused eslint-disable directives — removed all
- Lint result: 0 errors, 0 warnings (was 3 errors, 6 warnings)

Stage Summary:
- 12 files modified across security, data integrity, and correctness fixes
- New API endpoint: `/api/finance/moota/sync-balance` (server-side Moota sync, super_admin only)
- BankMutationsTab refactored: removed direct PATCH for balance, uses server endpoint + derived state
- Cash-flow direction categorization now works correctly (purchase payments show as outflow)
- Service worker (sw.js) no longer has parsing error
- All lint errors and warnings resolved

Task ID: 1
Agent: main
Task: Fix "Could not find the 'conversion_rate' column of 'products' in the schema cache" error

Work Log:
- Analyzed screenshot showing error in product edit modal
- Identified root cause: Prisma schema had `conversionRate` and `subUnit` fields without `@map()` directive
- Without `@map()`, Prisma created DB columns as camelCase (`conversionRate`, `subUnit`)
- But INSERT/UPDATE Supabase queries used snake_case (`conversion_rate`, `sub_unit`) → column not found
- Added `@map("conversion_rate")` to conversionRate field in prisma/schema.prisma
- Added `@map("sub_unit")` to subUnit field in prisma/schema.prisma
- Renamed DB columns manually via SQL: ALTER TABLE products RENAME COLUMN "conversionRate" TO conversion_rate, ALTER TABLE products RENAME COLUMN "subUnit" TO sub_unit
- Verified data preserved (6 products with conversion rates intact)
- Pushed Prisma schema (already in sync)
- Fixed 13 files with 15 Supabase .select() string changes from camelCase to snake_case
- Key insight: project has toCamelCase() helper that auto-converts Supabase response keys, so JS property access stays camelCase
- Re-installed pg package (was accidentally removed during cleanup)
- Verified: zero lint errors, app compiles and runs

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: Missing @map() directives in Prisma schema for conversionRate and subUnit
- Fixed schema, renamed DB columns (data preserved), updated all Supabase queries
- All 15 .select() strings now use snake_case matching actual DB column names
- JS property access unchanged (toCamelCase() helper handles conversion)

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix HTTP error 502 when creating invoice (Buat Faktur) from sale form cart

Work Log:
- Investigated POST /api/transactions handler for potential code bugs related to column rename
- Verified PRODUCT_FINANCIAL_SELECT uses correct snake_case (conversion_rate, sub_unit)
- Verified SmartProduct interface uses camelCase (conversionRate, subUnit) — toCamelCase() handles conversion
- Verified transaction_items INSERT uses correct snake_case column names
- Found old `app/` directory still existed alongside `src/app/` — potential Turbopack conflict causing double compilation and memory pressure
- Renamed old `app/` to `app.bak.*` (no references from src/ found)
- Added unhandled rejection + uncaught exception handlers in instrumentation.ts to prevent silent process crashes
- Added retry logic with idempotency key (X-Idempotency-Key) in SaleForm handleSubmit
- SaleForm now retries up to 2 times on 502/503/504 errors with 2s and 4s delays
- Idempotency key format: `sale-{unitId}-{productIds}-{timestamp}` — prevents duplicate transactions on retry

Stage Summary:
- No code bug found in the POST handler — the column rename from previous session was correctly applied
- Root cause: Server instability — Turbopack compilation with duplicate `app/` directory caused excessive memory usage, leading to process kills (502 from Caddy gateway)
- Fix 1: Removed old `app/` directory to reduce Turbopack compilation scope
- Fix 2: Added process-level crash handlers (unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
- Fix 3: SaleForm now auto-retries on 502/503/504 with idempotency key (no duplicate transactions)
- Files modified: src/instrumentation.ts, src/components/erp/SaleForm.tsx

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix pengguna & karyawan - role custom - unauthorized issue

Work Log:
- Investigated the role/authorization system across the entire codebase
- Found root cause 1: PATCH /api/users/[id] had VALID_ROLES = ['super_admin', 'sales', 'kurir', 'keuangan', 'gudang'] which blocked custom roles like "OB", "Sopir" with "Role tidak valid"
- Found root cause 2: EditUserForm in UsersModule.tsx only showed built-in ROLES in the role dropdown, so custom role users couldn't be properly edited
- Fixed PATCH endpoint: renamed VALID_ROLES → BUILT_IN_ROLES, added logic to allow custom roles when user has custom_role_id
- Added customRoleId handling in PATCH: when customRoleId is provided, verifies the custom role exists in DB and updates both custom_role_id and role fields
- Fixed EditUserForm: added customRoles prop, detects isNonErp user, shows custom role dropdown (by customRoleId) for non-ERP employees instead of built-in roles
- Removed email field from edit form for non-ERP employees (auto-generated internal email not editable)
- Removed password field from edit form for non-ERP employees (can't log in)
- Removed status field from edit form for non-ERP employees (always approved)
- Passed customRoles prop from parent UsersModule to EditUserForm

Stage Summary:
- /api/users/[id]/route.ts: Added custom role support in PATCH handler
- UsersModule.tsx: EditUserForm now properly handles custom role users with dedicated UI
- Lint: 0 errors, 1 warning (from backup file)

Task ID: 3
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix custom role "unauthorized" — add permissions system for custom roles

Work Log:
- Deep investigation revealed that the entire role/permission system only supports 4 built-in roles
- Custom roles store their name in users.role (e.g., "OB") but ALL module filtering and API checks use hardcoded role comparisons
- This means custom role users see empty sidebar (no modules) and get 403 on every API call
- Added `permissions` text field to CustomRole model in Prisma schema (stores JSON array of built-in roles)
- Ran `bun run db:push` to sync schema
- Created `src/lib/role-permissions.ts` with resolveEffectiveRoles(), parsePermissionsJson(), fetchEffectiveRolesFromDB(), hasAnyRole(), hasRole()
- Updated User type: added customRoleId, customRole, effectiveRoles fields; widened UserRole to accept string
- Updated login API: fetches custom_role relation, resolves and returns effectiveRoles
- Updated page.tsx: both sidebar and bottom nav module filtering now use effectiveRoles
- Updated page.tsx: dashboard renderModule now uses effectiveRoles to choose SalesDashboard vs CourierDashboard vs DashboardModule
- Rewrote require-auth.ts: added getAuthUserWithRoles(), hasEffectiveRoles(), updated enforceFinanceRole to support custom roles
- Updated transactions API GET: uses fetchEffectiveRolesFromDB for sales-only filtering and financial data stripping
- Updated transactions API POST: resolves allowed transaction types from effective roles (union of all role permissions)
- Rewrote custom-roles API POST: accepts permissions array, validates against BUILT_IN_ROLES, stores as JSON
- Rewrote custom-roles API PATCH: handles permissions update
- Updated UsersModule: CustomRoleItem type includes permissions, added PERMISSION_ROLES constants
- Updated UsersModule: custom role creation form has permissions checkboxes
- Updated UsersModule: custom role edit form shows permissions checkboxes, pre-populated from existing
- Updated UsersModule: custom role list shows permission badges
- Lint: 0 errors

Stage Summary:
- New file: src/lib/role-permissions.ts — central helper for resolving custom role permissions
- Schema: custom_roles.permissions (text, JSON array of built-in roles)
- Login now returns effectiveRoles for custom role users
- Frontend module filtering (sidebar + bottom nav) uses effectiveRoles
- Transactions API uses effective roles for both GET filtering and POST permission checks
- Custom role management UI: create/edit forms include permission checkboxes
- Users with custom roles that have permissions configured will now see modules and access APIs

Task ID: fix-docker-login-500
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix "Unexpected token 'I', Internal Server Error" on Docker/STB login

Work Log:
- Error: `Unexpected token 'I', "Internal S"... is not valid JSON` when logging in on STB
- This means the Next.js server returns HTML "Internal Server Error" page instead of JSON
- Traced through: LoginPage.tsx → res.json() fails because response is HTML, not JSON
- Root cause: Dockerfile Stage 3 (runner) copied node_modules from `deps` (Stage 1) instead of `builder` (Stage 2)
- `prisma generate` runs in Stage 2, outputting to `node_modules/.prisma/client/`
- Stage 1's node_modules does NOT have the generated Prisma client
- When the login route imports `@/lib/supabase` → `new PrismaClient()` at module level → crash → HTML 500 error

Fix 1 — Dockerfile:
- Changed `COPY --from=deps` to `COPY --from=builder` for node_modules in Stage 3
- Added comment explaining why builder stage is required (prisma generate output)

Fix 2 — LoginPage.tsx (defense in depth):
- Wrapped all `res.json()` calls in try-catch blocks
- Non-JSON responses now show user-friendly "Terjadi kesalahan server" instead of raw JSON parse error
- Applied to: login, register, forgot-password, reset-password, resend-code flows

Push: Committed and pushed to main → CI/CD rebuild triggered

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: Dockerfile copying wrong stage for node_modules (missing Prisma generated client)
- Fix: COPY --from=builder instead of COPY --from=deps
- Frontend: Safe JSON parsing with user-friendly error messages
- Commit: dcb89c2 - pushed to GitHub, CI/CD rebuild in progress

Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix login 500 "terjadi kesalahan server" - PGRST201 ambiguous FK

Work Log:
- Error reproduced locally: POST /api/auth/login → 500
- Server log: `[Login] DB error: Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'users' and 'custom_roles' PGRST201`
- Investigated DB: found TWO foreign keys between users and custom_roles:
  1. users.custom_role_id → custom_roles.id (the FK we want for the embed)
  2. custom_roles.createdById → users.id (reverse reference, added by Prisma schema)
- PostgREST couldn't determine which FK to use for `custom_role:custom_roles(*)` embed
- Fix: Use explicit FK hint in PostgREST select syntax:
  `custom_role:custom_roles(*)` → `custom_role:custom_roles!users_custom_role_id_fkey(*)`
- Updated .env AUTH_SECRET to match user's Supabase dashboard value
- Verified fix: login with wrong password returns 401 (correct) instead of 500

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: PGRST201 — ambiguous FK relationship between users and custom_roles tables
- Fix: Explicit FK hint `!users_custom_role_id_fkey` in PostgREST select
- Login now works correctly: 401 for wrong credentials, 500 fixed
- Commit: 8b510ec - pushed to GitHub, CI/CD rebuild triggered

Task ID: fix-stale-unit-fk
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix "customers_unit_id_fkey" FK violation, "Unit/Cabang tidak ditemukan" when creating invoice, and "data transaksi tidak tersinkron"

Work Log:
- Investigated customer FK violation: found `selectedUnitId` in localStorage can become stale (unit deleted/reset/reseeded)
- Fixed page.tsx: Added useEffect to auto-clear stale selectedUnitId when unit no longer exists in units list
- Fixed api/customers POST: Added unit existence validation before INSERT (prevents FK violation with clear error message)
- Fixed CustomerManagementModule: Added `validUnitId` validation against units list (prevents sending stale ID)
- Investigated "data transaksi tidak tersinkron": Found ensure-rpc.ts was NOT deploying RPC functions because SUPABASE_DB_URL/SUPABASE_POOLER_URL were not set in some environments
- Fixed ensure-rpc.ts: Added fallback to DATABASE_URL/DIRECT_URL when explicit RPC env vars are not set
- Verified RPC deployment: 26/26 functions deployed successfully
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings

Stage Summary:
- Root cause 1 (FK violation): Stale `selectedUnitId` in localStorage after DB reset/unit deletion
- Root cause 2 (unit not found): Same stale ID sent to transactions API for invoice creation
- Root cause 3 (data not synced): RPC functions not deployed → stock deduction, customer stats, balance ops silently failed
- Fix 1: Auto-clear stale selectedUnitId on app load
- Fix 2: Backend validation of unitId before customer INSERT
- Fix 3: Frontend validation of selectedUnitId against actual units list
- Fix 4: ensure-rpc.ts falls back to DATABASE_URL/DIRECT_URL
- Commit: 3889bc8 - pushed to GitHub, CI/CD rebuild triggered

### Task 1: Enhanced middleware.ts (Global API Security Guard)
- Added 3-tier rate limiting: Global (300/min), Auth (20/min), Strict Auth (5/15min for register/forgot-password)
- Added request body size check (max 10MB via Content-Length header)
- Added CORS preflight handler (OPTIONS → 204 with proper headers)
- Added client IP extraction from x-forwarded-for / x-real-ip headers
- Added security event logging (rate limited, missing auth, invalid tokens)
- Added suspicious token pattern blocking (HTML/SQL injection chars in token)
- Max store size 10,000 entries with LRU eviction to prevent memory leaks
- Added missing public paths: /api/pwa-orders/pending, /api/pwa-orders/approve, /api/c/[code]/

### Task 2: Password Max Length in Zod Schemas (bcrypt DoS Prevention)
- Added .max(72) to all password fields (login, register, change-password, reset-password)
- bcrypt silently truncates at 72 chars — long passwords can cause DoS via CPU-heavy hashing
- Added .max(254) to email fields (RFC 5321 maximum)
- Added .max(20) to phone field in register schema

### Task 3: Error Message Leaking Fix — 21 instances across 17 files
Scanned all ~130 API route files, found and fixed 21 error leaking instances:
- storage/supabase-quota/route.ts — raw error.message in response
- customers/route.ts — Supabase PostgrestError.message in response (2 instances)
- settings/logo/route.ts — Supabase error.message in response
- migrate-customer-pwa/route.ts — 4 instances (array of raw SQL errors returned to client)
- ai/broadcast/route.ts — 2 instances (GET and POST handlers)
- products/generate-image/route.ts — raw error.message in response
- ai/tts/route.ts — raw error.message in response
- generate-image/route.ts — raw error.message + English fallback
- ai/financial-snapshot/route.ts — raw error in `details` field
- print/route.ts — raw error.message appended to response
- transactions/[id]/route.ts — 2 instances (GET and PATCH handlers)
- finance/requests/route.ts — raw PostgrestError forwarded to client on 500
- finance/requests/[id]/route.ts — raw DB error on 400 for constraint keyword
- system/restore/route.ts — array of raw SQL errors returned to client
- customers/generate-codes/route.ts — raw Supabase error in response
- courier/handover/route.ts — raw RPC error on 500 fallback
- pwa-orders/approve/route.ts — raw RPC error appended to message
All replaced with generic Indonesian error messages. Actual errors kept in console.error only.

### Task 4: Token Blacklist/Revocation Mechanism
Created new file: src/lib/token-blacklist.ts
- In-memory token revocation with two strategies:
  1. Per-token blacklist (logout): stores "userId:timestamp" pair
  2. Per-user revocation (password change): any token issued before revocation time is rejected
- Max 50,000 entries with LRU eviction
- 7-day TTL matching token expiry
- Periodic cleanup every 30 minutes
Updated token.ts: Added isTokenBlacklisted() check in verifyAuthToken()
Updated logout/route.ts: Added blacklistToken() on logout
Updated change-password/route.ts: Added blacklistAllUserTokens() on password change

### Task 5: Input Sanitization (Already Adequate)
- Verified existing sanitizedString() and sanitizedStringOptional() in validators.ts already handle:
  - Control character removal (null bytes, control chars)
  - Max length enforcement
  - Whitespace trimming
- Supabase client uses parameterized queries internally — SQL injection not possible
- No additional sanitization needed

### Task 6: Audit Logging for Critical Operations
Added structured createLog() calls to 3 files (9 new logging points):
- auth/login/route.ts: login_success + login_failed (with IP tracking)
- auth/register/route.ts: user_registered (ERP + non-ERP paths)
- users/[id]/route.ts: user_approved + user_deactivated
(transaction approve, cancel, and finance request routes already had audit logging)

Stage Summary:
- 1 new file created: src/lib/token-blacklist.ts
- 25+ files modified across all 6 tasks
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Dev server: GET / 200, GET /api/health 200
- Security improvements: rate limiting, token revocation, error leak fixes, audit logging
- All changes are backward compatible — no breaking changes to existing API behavior

Task ID: month2-3-implementation
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Month 2-3 Roadmap — Supabase Realtime, Saga pattern, Push, Email, QRIS

Work Log:

### 1. Supabase Realtime Integration
- Created src/hooks/use-supabase-realtime.ts — client-side hook with postgres_changes subscriptions
- Monitors 8 tables: events, transactions, products, payments, finance_requests, deliveries, users, customers
- Adaptive debounce: 300ms critical, 800ms medium, 1500ms normal
- Replaced useRealtimeSync() with useSupabaseRealtime() in src/app/page.tsx
- Zero infrastructure needed — no WebSocket mini-service required
- Supabase Realtime must be enabled for subscribed tables in Supabase Dashboard

### 2. Saga Pattern (Compensating Transactions)
- Rewrote src/app/api/transactions/[id]/approve/route.ts:
  - 3-step saga: optimistic lock → fetch products → process stock changes
  - Each step has rollback function
  - Stock reversal on approval failure (prevents partial deduction data corruption)
- Rewrote src/app/api/transactions/[id]/cancel/route.ts:
  - 8-step saga: reverse stock → cancel receivable → reverse payments → reverse pools → reverse courier cash → delete payments → reverse customer stats
  - Compensating rollback for all steps

### 3. PWA Push Notifications
- Created src/lib/push-notifications.ts — Web Push with VAPID authentication
- Created src/app/api/push/subscribe/route.ts — POST (save), DELETE (remove)
- Created src/app/api/push/send/route.ts — POST (broadcast), GET (VAPID key)
- Updated public/sw.js to v7 with push event handler + notification click routing
- Added PushSubscription model to prisma/schema.prisma

### 4. Email Notifications (Resend)
- Created src/lib/email-service.ts with 4 HTML email templates:
  - transactionApprovedTemplate, paymentReceivedTemplate, lowStockTemplate, newOrderTemplate
- Created src/app/api/notifications/email/route.ts — POST (send), GET (config check)
- Professional responsive HTML templates in Indonesian

### 5. QRIS Payment (Tripay)
- Created src/lib/qris-service.ts — create, status check, signature verification
- Created src/app/api/payments/qris/create/route.ts — create QRIS for transaction
- Created src/app/api/payments/qris/callback/route.ts — Tripay webhook with auto-payment processing
- Added QrisPayment model to prisma/schema.prisma
- Added QRIS callback to middleware PUBLIC_PATHS

### 6. Infrastructure
- Installed packages: web-push@3.6.7, resend@6.12.2
- Updated .env.example with VAPID, Resend, Tripay env vars
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings

Task ID: final-roadmap-cleanup
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Final roadmap items — virtual scrolling, Supabase Storage CDN, dead code cleanup

Work Log:

### 1. Virtual Scrolling
- Installed @tanstack/react-virtual@3.13.24
- Created src/components/ui/virtual-list.tsx with two components:
  - VirtualGrid: CSS grid layout (for products), row-based virtualization
  - VirtualTable: List layout (for transactions), item-based virtualization
- ProductsModule: auto-switches to VirtualGrid when products.length > 30
- Normal CSS grid for ≤30 products (avoids overhead)

### 2. Supabase Storage Image Upload
- Created src/lib/image-upload.ts:
  - uploadProductImage(): File → Supabase Storage CDN URL
  - uploadBase64Image(): base64 data URL → CDN URL
  - deleteProductImage(): remove from storage
  - isBase64Image(): detect base64 vs CDN URL
  - getBase64Size(): calculate base64 byte size
- Created /api/products/upload-image: multipart form upload endpoint
- Created /api/products/migrate-images: batch migration endpoint
  - GET: dry run (count base64 images + total size)
  - POST: actual migration with progress tracking
- Updated ProductsModule handleImageUpload:
  - Tries CDN upload first, falls back to base64 if Storage unavailable
  - Increased max file size from 2MB to 5MB
  - Uses URL.createObjectURL for instant preview

### 3. Dead Code Cleanup
- Deleted 4 dead files (430 lines total):
  - src/components/ui/toast.tsx (129 lines, zero imports)

Task ID: fix-pwa-unauthorized
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix PWA pelanggan unauthorized error

Work Log:
- Investigated PWA customer page at /c/[code] which calls /api/pwa/[code]/* endpoints
- Found middleware PUBLIC_PATHS had '/api/c/[code]/' but actual API routes are at '/api/pwa/[code]/'
- This caused ALL PWA customer API calls (products, orders, referrals, etc.) to be blocked by middleware returning 401 Unauthorized
- Also found /api/settings was not in PUBLIC_PATHS — PWA customer page needs /api/settings?public=true for company logo/name
- The settings route already handles auth internally (public=true returns only safe keys, otherwise requires auth)
- Fixed: Changed '/api/c/[code]/' to '/api/pwa/[code]/' in PUBLIC_PATHS
- Fixed: Added '/api/settings' to PUBLIC_PATHS

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: Middleware had wrong path pattern '/api/c/[code]/' instead of '/api/pwa/[code]/'
- All PWA customer endpoints were blocked: /api/pwa/[code], /api/pwa/[code]/products, /api/pwa/[code]/orders, etc.
- 1 file modified: src/middleware.ts (2 insertions, 1 deletion)
- Commit: 6d2dc3e pushed to GitHub

Task ID: fix-pwa-kode-tidak-ditemukan
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix PWA customer "Kode Tidak Ditemukan" error

Work Log:
- User reported PWA pelanggan showing "Kode Tidak Ditemukan" error
- Investigated middleware PUBLIC_PATHS matching logic
- Found root cause: `'/api/pwa/[code]/'` in PUBLIC_PATHS is a LITERAL string
- `pathname.startsWith('/api/pwa/[code]/')` returns FALSE for actual URLs like `/api/pwa/ABC123`
- Because `[code]` is a Next.js route parameter, not matched by plain string comparison
- Previous fix changed from `/api/c/[code]/` to `/api/pwa/[code]/` but never addressed the fundamental issue
- All PWA customer API calls were being blocked by auth middleware → 401 → customer=null → "Kode Tidak Ditemukan"
- Fix: Changed to `/api/pwa/` prefix which correctly matches ALL PWA routes via startsWith
- Also consolidated `/api/pwa/icon` and `/api/pwa/manifest` into the single `/api/pwa/` prefix (redundant)
- Lint: 0 errors, 2 warnings (pre-existing)

Stage Summary:
- Root cause: Literal `[code]` string in PUBLIC_PATHS never matched dynamic route URLs
- Fix: Replaced `/api/pwa/[code]/` + `/api/pwa/icon` + `/api/pwa/manifest` with single `/api/pwa/` prefix
- Commit: a891769 - pushed to GitHub, CI/CD rebuild triggered

Task ID: fix-pwa-realtime-remove-push-email
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix PWA customer error, Realtime setup error, remove Push VAPID & Email Resend

Work Log:

### 1. PWA "Kode Tidak Ditemukan" Fix
- Previous middleware fix (a891769) was correct: `/api/pwa/` prefix matches all PWA routes
- But investigation revealed the API route masked ALL errors (including 500 server errors) as 404 "Kode tidak ditemukan"
- Frontend also masked all errors as "Kode Tidak Ditemukan" (only had `if (!customer)` check)
- Fixed API: Check error.code === 'PGRST116' to distinguish genuine not-found from connection errors
- Fixed Frontend: Added `customerNotFound` state, set on HTTP 404 only; 500 errors now show toast

### 2. Supabase Realtime "Gagal: Aktifkan Realtime" Fix
- Found in SetupTab.tsx: `handleAction` only checked `result.error` but not `result.message`
- The enable-realtime API returns `{ success: false, message: "..." }` for partial failures
- Fixed: `toast.error(result.error || result.message || ...)` — now shows the actual backend message

### 3. Push Notification VAPID — Complete Removal
- Deleted 6 files: push-notifications.ts, email-service.ts, 4 API routes
- Removed PushSubscription model from prisma/schema.prisma
- Removed push handlers from public/sw.js (upgraded v7→v8)
- Removed VAPID setup item + VAPID dialog from SetupTab.tsx (6→4 checks)
- Removed checkVapid() from setup/status/route.ts
- Removed web-push + resend packages (bun remove)
- Removed VAPID/RESEND env vars from .env.example

### 4. Email Notification Resend — Complete Removal  
- Same commit as above — all email-related code deleted

Stage Summary:
- Commit: 8be855a — pushed to GitHub, CI/CD rebuild triggered
- 16 files changed (+33, -1083 lines), 6 files deleted, 2 packages removed
- Lint: 0 errors, 2 warnings (pre-existing)
- Setup checks reduced from 6 to 4 (Schema, Realtime, Storage, Tripay)
---
Task ID: fix-dbpush-vapid-email-cleanup
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Remove remaining VAPID/Email from pengaturan, fix db-push failure

Work Log:

### 1. Verify VAPID/Email Removal
- Checked all source files for remaining references to push-notification, email-service, VAPID, resend
- Only remaining 'Bell' references are legitimate UI icons in StorageTab (database monitoring) and page.tsx (notifications bell), not push notification related
- SettingsModule.tsx Integrasi tab only has TripaySettingsTab — no VAPID/Email
- SetupTab already cleaned up in previous commit

### 2. Fix db-push "Gagal mempush schema ke database"
- Root cause: prisma db push fails when dropping the removed push_subscriptions table
- Even with --accept-data-loss, some Prisma versions/Docker environments can fail
- Fix: Rewrote db-push route with 3-step approach:
  1. Run prisma generate first (ensures client is current)
  2. Try prisma db push --accept-data-loss
  3. If fails: direct SQL fallback (DROP TABLE push_subscriptions, DELETE vapid_config setting), then retry prisma db push
- Added 'detail' and 'hint' response fields with actual error output
- Updated SetupTab handleAction to show error detail in toast description

Stage Summary:
- Commit: 24ef673 — pushed to GitHub, CI/CD rebuild triggered
- 2 files changed (+95, -20 lines)
- Lint: 0 errors, 2 warnings (pre-existing)

Task ID: fix-realtime-remove-schema
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix Realtime 8 errors, hapus Database Schema dari SetupTab, cek bugs, push

Work Log:
- Realtime "8 error": Root cause was PgBouncer blocking DDL + deliveries table not existing + CREATE PUBLICATION failing silently
- Rewrote enable-realtime/route.ts: Uses DIRECT_URL (bypasses PgBouncer), queries pg_publication first to find existing tables, handles permission errors with clear Supabase Dashboard instructions
- Removed `deliveries` table from REALTIME_TABLES (7 tables now, no deliveries model in Prisma)
- Removed Database Schema from SetupTab entirely — dangerous db-push button removed
- Deleted db-push API route (src/app/api/setup/db-push/route.ts)
- Simplified status API: removed checkSchema(), only realtime + storage + imageMigration
- SetupTab: 2 checks only (Realtime, Storage), removed unused imports (Database, Rocket, Separator, ExternalLink, Label)
- Verified: 0 lint errors, 0 broken imports, GET / 200 OK
- Pushed to GitHub: commit 4301ab3

Stage Summary:
- enable-realtime: Now queries existing publication tables, uses DIRECT_URL, gives clear hint if permission denied
- SetupTab: Clean 2-item setup (Realtime + Storage) — no dangerous db-push button
- db-push route deleted entirely
- Lint: 0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings (TanStack Virtual)
- CI/CD rebuild triggered on push
